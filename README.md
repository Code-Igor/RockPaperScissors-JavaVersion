#RockPaperScissors 

We created a rock, paper, and scissors game to be played directly in the terminal. 
It use Abstract class, Interface, Enum and a Ranking system (writing in the ranking.txt file) using Map.
It works like the normal game, but here you need to give a name, which will be used to store the number of rounds that you won during the game.
You lose the game when you lose a total of 3 rounds. So you have 3 lifes. The main object is to reach as far as possible to be on the top of the ranking.

We also created an Class Diagram.
